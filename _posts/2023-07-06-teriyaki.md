Teriyaki Sauce Notes - 

Sake is a Japanese wine made from fermented rice. It is also commonly used in Japanese cooking, usually in sauces or marinades. Sake can be substituted for 1 part rice wine vinegar to 3 parts water, so for this recipe, you will need 50ml rice wine vinegar and 150ml of water.

Mirin is a Japanese rice wine similar to Sake. Mirin has a lower alcohol level than Sake but contains more sugar. For those that can't consume alcohol, it can be substituted for 1 part sugar to 3 parts water, so for this recipe, you will need 50g of sugar and 150ml of water. 

Ingredients if you don't consume alcohol -

Makes -  250ml 

60ml (1/4 Cup) - Soy Sauce 
40ml (2 Tbsp) - Dark Soy Sauce
50g (2 1/2 Tbsp) - White Sugar 
125ml (1/2 Cup) - Vegetable or Chicken Stock 

Both soy sauces are interchangeable which means you can use one for the other or omit one completely. If you don't use dark soy sauce the teriyaki sauce will be a lot lighter in colour. 

Brown Rice & Bok Choy Notes - 

Brown rice is the healthier alternative to white rice but if you prefer basmati rice can be used. The choice is all yours. 

The way I cooked the rice in this video will no doubt cause controversy with the people that always have to be right. The way it's cooked in this video is one of, if not the best ways to achieve perfect brown rice. 

If you're not a fan of bok choy it can be substituted for any of your favourite veggies.
